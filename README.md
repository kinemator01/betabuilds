# 🚀 BetaBuilds - Web Development Agency

This is the official website for **BetaBuilds**, my small web development agency based in Cape Town.  
I built it to showcase what I do, the services I offer, and to give people an easy way to reach out if they want a site done.

## 📖 What’s Inside

The site is simple and straight to the point:
- A **Home/Hero section** with the main tagline + image.
- A **Services section** showing what I offer (web design, responsive dev, SEO, site management, logo design).
- An **About section** to introduce BetaBuilds and what we’re about.
- A **Packages section** (basic website design deal for R299 p/m).
- A **Contact section** with business hours and social links.
- A **Floating CTA button** for quick contact.
- A **Footer** with socials.
